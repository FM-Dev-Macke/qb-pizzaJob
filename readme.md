This is a resource i created for a server as a "Developer test", Using qb-target as a dependenci.

I have not tested the payment part of the script as it was on a localhost server. 
Hope y'all enjoy the script and feel free too ask me any questions. 

(This script isn't something i've put alot of time into)

Look through the client and server main.lua too see all the items you have to add.
